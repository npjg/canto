  The Song of Songs, __ _ _ the love -- liest song,

  And _ all his lov -- ers sing.

  Draw me, I will __ _ _ run a -- fter thee,
  Thou art my heart's one choice;

  To dwell there and re -- joice.
  There in thy pres -- ence, O my King, 
  To _ feast and hear thy voice.

   And set his love on me.
   I shall be per -- fect -- ed by Love,
